    <p id="intro_text">Thought I found a way. Thought I found a way, out (found). But you never go away (never go away)
    So I guess I gotta stay now. Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here.
    Even if it takes all night or a hundred years. Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
    Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear. Isn't it lovely, all alone? Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    Tear me to pieces, skin to bone. Hello, welcome home. Walkin' out of town.
    Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place). Something's on my mind (mind). Always in my head space
    But I know some day I'll make it out of here. Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.

    Hello, welcome home. Whoa, yeah. Yeah, ah. Whoa, whoa. Hello, welcome home</p>
