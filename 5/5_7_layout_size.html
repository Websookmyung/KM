      Thought I found a way
      Thought I found a way, out (found)
      But you never go away (never go away)
      So I guess I gotta stay now
      Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
      Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
      Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
      Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
      Isn't it lovely, all alone?
      Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
      Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
      Hello, welcome home
      Walkin' out of town
      Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
      Something's on my mind (mind)
      Always in my head space
      But I know some day I'll make it out of here
      Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
      Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
      Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
      Isn't it lovely, all alone?
      Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
      Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
      Hello, welcome home
      Whoa, yeah
      Yeah, ah
      Whoa, whoa
      Hello, welcome home
